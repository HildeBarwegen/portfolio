		Every year, for thirteen years in a row, Pristina has had a student film and theater festival called “Skena Up”. I learned about this when I was there and met Vullnet, who runs satirical website <a href=“http://www.kukunews.net/”>kukunews.net</a> and organises this event. He asked me to make a poster, which I happily did. This year however the government stopped funding them, which made it much more difficult to continue. As a protest, they would only show interrupted and unfinished films and plays. Unfortunately the event could not yet be organized with their current problems, so the festival really is interrupted.
